Task:
You are playing the video game Montezuma's Revenge. I have placed you in a loop where I will provide you with the four most recent frames and you need to respond with what key to press. Try to do as well as possible! Montezuma's Revenge is an exciting adventure game where you play as Panama Joe, exploring the treacherous chambers of Emperor Montezuma's pyramid in search of treasure. Here's what you need to know to get started:

Objective:
Guide Panama Joe through 11 increasingly challenging levels, collecting valuable items and tools while avoiding hazards and creatures. The game ends when you lose all 5 lives, so try to score as many points as possible!

Gameplay:
Each level introduces new barriers, darker chambers, and altered paths to the Treasure Room. You'll encounter locked doors that require specific keys (red, blue, grey), ladders, ropes, and poles for traversing levels, and disappearing floors over deadly pits. 

Avoid or eliminate creatures like rolling/bouncing skulls, snakes, spiders, and mummies. Use tools strategically, such as the sword to eliminate creatures, torch to illuminate dark rooms, and amulet for an extra life. Collect jewels worth 1000-5000 points and deposit them in the Treasure Room.

The Inventory Window displays your current items (up to 5). Once full, you must use or deposit them before collecting more. A single hit from a creature or hazard will cost you a life and all points accumulated in that life.

Scoring:
- Open a locked door: 300 points
- Eliminate a skull/snake/spider with the sword: 2000-3000 points
- Collect a jewel: 1000-5000 points
- Gain an extra life: Every 10,000 points (levels 1-3) or 20,000 points (levels 4+)

Tips:
- Memorize the layout of each chamber to navigate darker levels
- Time your jumps carefully to cross disappearing floors
- Fill your inventory with valuable items before heading to the Treasure Room
- Eliminate creatures whenever possible to earn more points
- Keep an eye out for the amulet to gain extra lives
